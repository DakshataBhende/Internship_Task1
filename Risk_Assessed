# 135/tcp – Microsoft RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
-Risk: This port is used for Microsoft's DCOM and RPC services. It is frequently targeted by worms and malware (e.g., Blaster, Sasser).
-Exploitation Potential: Remote code execution vulnerabilities.
                        Used as an entry point to enumerate services and launch attacks.
-Recommendation: Block this port externally; allow only if necessary within a secure internal network.

# 139/tcp – NetBIOS Session Service
-Risk: NetBIOS is used for Windows file and printer sharing over older protocols. It is vulnerable to:
-Information disclosure (e.g., usernames, shares).
-Pass-the-hash attacks and man-in-the-middle (MitM) via SMB.
-Recommendation: Disable if not needed. Never expose to the internet.

# 445/tcp – Microsoft-DS (Direct SMB over TCP)
-Risk: This port is used for SMB (Server Message Block) – modern file and printer sharing in Windows.
-Common Exploits: EternalBlue (used in WannaCry, NotPetya).
                  Ransomware and wormable SMB attacks.
-Recommendation: Critical to block on public interfaces. Allow only inside secure, segmented networks.

# 7070/tcp – RealServer (RealAudio/RealVideo Streaming)
-Risk: Less common today, but when used:
-May expose outdated streaming services.
-Could allow remote exploitation if running unpatched versions.
